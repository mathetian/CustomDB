Cache
===
LRUCache and FIFOCache are supported in our library. 

## Version 1
The first version of cache is adopted from [ImageLoader](https://github.com/nostra13/Android-Universal-Image-Loader).

`ImageLoader` provides `LRUCache`, `LRUCache` and others. 

## Version 2
The second version of cache is adopted from [leveldb](http://leveldb.googlecode.com).

`leveldb` provides `LRUCache` as the default schedule of cache.
