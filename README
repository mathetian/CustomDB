A light-weight JSONBased Database System

------------------------------------------
TODO List:

1. Test
2. JSON
3. Lock
4. Parallel
5. Other support
6. Vim or others

------------------------------------------

I guess I will make some other tasks to implement the DB, like 3.

Also,

7. Memory Pool 
8. Thread Pool
9. AIO, IOCP

Are very import in this project.
